## 🧭 Overview

This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline to classify forest cover types using cartographic and environmental variables.

Rather than focusing on a single model, the project emphasizes **model benchmarking, cross-validation, and performance comparison** across multiple supervised learning algorithms.

The objective is to evaluate how different classification approaches perform on a high-dimensional, multi-class dataset and identify the most robust model under consistent validation settings.

## ⚙️ Hyperparameter Optimization

A **Decision Tree (CART)** classifier was further optimized through grid-level experimentation on key hyperparameters:

### Parameters Evaluated

- **Criterion:** `gini`, `entropy`
- **Splitter:** `best`, `random`

### Best Configuration

```text
criterion = entropy
splitter = random
```

### Result

**Mean Cross-Validation Accuracy:** **0.7819 (~78.2%)**

Although the improvement was modest, it was consistent across validation folds, demonstrating the sensitivity of tree-based models to impurity measures and splitting strategies.

## 📌 Key Insights

The experiments highlight that model performance depends heavily on algorithm characteristics and preprocessing choices.

Key findings include:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** achieved the highest accuracy on the original feature space but degraded substantially after standardization.
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** produced stable performance regardless of feature scaling.
- **Logistic Regression** benefited significantly from standardization, improving from **38.7%** to **58.6%** accuracy.
- **Decision Trees** delivered consistently strong performance with only modest gains from hyperparameter tuning.

Overall, the project demonstrates the importance of:

- Selecting algorithms appropriate for the underlying data structure.
- Evaluating the effect of preprocessing rather than assuming it always improves performance.
- Using cross-validation to support reliable, data-driven model selection.
